About WYMeditor
===============

WYMeditor is a web-based WYSIWYM editor.

WYMeditor's main concept is to leave details of the document's visual layout,
and to concentrate on its structure and meaning, while trying to give the user
as much comfort as possible (at least as WYSIWYG editors).

WYMeditor has been created to generate perfectly structured XHTML strict code,
to conform to the W3C specifications and to facilitate further processing by
modern applications.

With WYMeditor, the code can't be contaminated by visual informations like font
styles and weights, borders, colors, ... The end-user defines content meaning,
which will determine its aspect by the use of style sheets. The result is easy
and quick maintenance of information.

As the code is compliant to W3C specifications, you can for example process it
using a XSLT (at the client or the server side), giving you a wide range of
applications.
